Thie repo contains content and build scripts for [web.dev](https://web.dev).

## Writing on web.dev

The site has two main content types: **guides** and **codelabs**.


- A guide is any written post or tutorial ([example](https://web.dev/fast/use-imagemin-to-compress-images)).
- A codelab is a step-by-step coding exercise, paired with an embedded Glitch editor ([example](https://web.dev/fast/use-imagemin-to-compress-images/codelab-imagemin-webpack)).

### Guides

Every subfolder of a learning path should contain a single `index.md`. That markdown file is where your guide lives, and the sub-directory gives it its URL. For example:

```
# Produces the URL: https://web.dev/fast/avoid-invisible-text
/fast/avoid-invisible-text/index.md
```

Authoring guidelines:

- If you want your image to be 100% width, just make sure it's >735px. Then Devsite will handle compressing it, and creating variations for `srcset`.
- Use sentence case throughout, i.e. "Measure web performance", instead of "Measure Web Performance".
- Key commands should look like ðŸ‘‰ "Open the DevTools by pressing `CMD + OPTION + i` / `CTRL + SHIFT + i`."
- Use `<pre class="prettyprint">` and escape HTML to make fancy code blocks:

```html
<pre class="prettyprint">
<s>&lt;div&gt;I am old busted&lt;/div&gt;</s>
<strong>&lt;div&gt;I am new hotness&lt;/div&gt;</strong>
</pre>
```

- Use `<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">` to wrap terminal commands. This'll insert a `$`.
- Put notes in `<div class="aside note">`. We also support `.caution`, `.warning`, `.success`.
- Many images just use markdown but you can also use the Web Fundamentals approach of figure/figcaption:
```
<figure>
  <img src="/apps-script/images/alert.png"
       alt="Alert dialog" class="screenshot">
  <figcaption><b>Figure 1</b>: Alert dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Codelabs

To create a codelab, add a markdown file to a content subdirectory and name it anything other than `index.md`.

```
# Produces the URL: https://web.dev/fast/avoid-invisible-text/codelab-avoid-invisible-text
/content/fast/avoid-invisible-text/codelab-avoid-invisible-text.md
```

- When you first mention a Glitch panel or button, put its name in bold, followed by a screenshot. You can use `<web-screenshot>` ([preview](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/web-screenshot)) to add the screenshot.

Example:
```
- Click the **Remix This** button to make the project editable.

<web-screenshot type="remix"></web-screenshot> # Remember to close the element!

- Click the **Status** button.

<web-screenshot type="status"></web-screenshot>

- Click the **Console** button.

<web-screenshot type="console"></web-screenshot>
```

- Most codelabs should start with an instruction for the user to Click the **Remix This** button, followed by `<web-screenshot type="remix"></web-screenshot>`

- Not everyone knows how to open the DevTools, so it can be helpful to give an instruction:

```
Open DevTools by pressing `CMD + OPTION + i` / `CTRL + SHIFT + i`.
```
