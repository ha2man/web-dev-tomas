# Style focus

The focus indicator (often signified by a "focus ring") identifies the currently
focused element. For users who are unable to use a mouse, this indicator is
_extremely important_, as it acts as a stand-in for their mouse-pointer.

If the browser's default focus indicator clashes with your design you can use
CSS to restyle it. Just remember to keep your keyboard users in mind!

## Use :focus to always show a focus indicator

The [`:focus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus)
pseudo-class matches any time an element is focused, regardless of the input
device (mouse, keyboard, stylus, etc.) or method used to focus it.

```  
button:focus {  
  outline: 4px dashed orange;  
}  
```

The button in this example will _always_ show a focus indicator. If you use a
mouse to click on it, or a keyboard to tab to it, the results are the same.

## Use :focus-visible to selectively show a focus indicator

The new
[:focus-visible]([https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible))
pseudo-class matches any time an element receives focus and the browser
determines via heuristics that display a focus indicator would be beneficial to
the user.

If the most recent user interaction was via the keyboard; and the key press did
not include a meta, alt/option, or control key, then `:focus-visible` will
match.

_Note that `:focus-visible` is currently only supported in Chrome behind a flag,
but there is a [lightweight polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible)
that can be added to your app to make it work._

```  
button:focus-visible {  
  Outline: 4px dashed orange;  
}  
```

The button in this example will _selectively_ show a focus indicator. If you use
a mouse to click on it, or a keyboard to tab to it, the results are different.

## When to display a focus indicator

A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself, "If you clicked on this control on a
mobile device, would you expect it to display a keyboard?"

If the answer is "yes", then the control should probably _always_ show a focus
indicator, regardless of the input device used to focus it. A good example is
the `<input type="text">` element. Regardless of how it receives focus, the user
will need to continue to send it input via the keyboard, so it's helpful for it
to display a focus indicator.

If the answer is "no", then the control should selectively show a focus
indicator. A good example is the `<button>` element. If a user clicks on it with
a mouse or touch screen, the action is complete and a focus indicator is no
longer needed. If the user is navigating with a keyboard it's useful to show a
focus indicator so they can decide whether or not they want to click the control
using the Enter or Space keys.

## Avoid outline: none

The way browsers decide when to draw a focus indicator is, frankly, very
confusing. Changing the appearance of a `<button>` element with CSS, or giving
an element a `tabindex` will cause the browser's default focus ring behavior to
kick-in.

A very common anti-pattern is to remove the focus indicator using CSS such as:  
```  
/* Don't do this!!! */  
:focus {  
  outline: none;  
}  
```

A better way to work around this issue is to use a combination of `:focus` and
the `:focus-visible` polyfill.

```  
/*  
  This will hide the focus indicator if the element receives focus via the
mouse,  
  but it will still show up on keyboard focus.  
*/  
.js-focus-visible :focus:not(.focus-visible) {  
  outline: none;  
}

/*  
  Optionally: Define a strong focus indicator for keyboard focus.  
  If you choose to skip this step then the browser's default focus  
  indicator will be displayed instead.  
*/  
.js-focus-visible .focus-visible {  
  â€¦  
}  
```
