  overview: `Making your content discoverable matters because it's how you get
  more relevant users viewing your content. If a search engine has trouble
  seeing your page, you're possibly missing out on a source of traffic.

  By making sure search engines can find and automatically understand your
  content, you are improving the visibility of your site for relevant searches.
  This is called SEO, or search engine optimization, which can result in more
  interested users coming to your site. Audit your site and check the SEO
  results to see how well search engines can surface your content.`,
