  overview: `When you're building a modern web experience, it's important to 
  measure, optimize, and monitor if you're to get fast and stay fast.
  Performance plays a significant role in the success of any online venture,
  as high performing sites engage and retain users better than poorly performing
  ones.
  
  Sites should focus on optimizing for user-centric happiness metrics. Tools
  like Lighthouse (baked into web.dev!) highlight these metrics and help you
  take the right steps toward improving your performance. To "stay fast", set
  and enforce performance budgets to help your team work within the constraints
  needed to continue loading fast and keeping users happy after your site has
  launched.`,
